Installing of the GDMA program

To compile the program you will need a Fortran90 or later compiler.
The gfortran compiler is used by default. Change to the main gdma
directory, check that the settings in the Makefile are appropriate
for your compiler, and run
  make
If the compilation is successful, the new executable will be in
gdma/bin/gdma.

Use
  make test
to run the test files through the program. The test script checks
whether the output is correct, and leaves a report in
gdma/examples/test.log. If all is well, you can use
  make install
will put the executable in /usr/local/bin. You will probably have to
be root to do that. You can change the definition of INSTALL_DIR in the
Makefile if necessary, for example to install the executable in your
personal bin directory.

The detailed documentation is in the file doc/manual.pdf.
